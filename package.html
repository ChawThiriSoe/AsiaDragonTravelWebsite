	 		Naypyidaw is the new capital and seat of government was famous in these years. About 300 km north of Yangon, the former capital was announced on Armed Forces Day in March 2006. The official explanation for moving the capital was that Yangon had become too congested and crowded with little room for future expansion of government offices. It takes about nine hours by train from Yangon to Naypyidaw. The regular flights from domestic airlines fly to Nay Pyi Taw Airport, located 10 miles southeast of the city. A new highway from Yangon to Nay Pyi Taw has been opened recently and now the travelling time from Yangon to Nay Pyi Taw is only about 4 hours drive. City Hall is one of the prominent Land Marks of Nay Pyi Taw, in which Nay Pyi Taw Development Committee establishes its head quarters. Uppatasanti Pagoda, the replica of Shwedagon Pagoda from Yangon is the main pagoda from this capital. Water fountain Garden is the best picnic place for the people. The gem museum Naypyidaw is fully covered with the jade stones.

	 		Naypyidaw is located between the Bago Yoma and Shan Yoma mountain ranges. The city covers an area of 7,054.37 square km and has a population of 924,608, according to official figures. Chaungmagyi Dam is located a few kilometers to the north of Naypyidaw, while Ngalaik Dam is a few kilometers to the south. The Yezin Dam is further away, to the northeast. Ngalaik Lake Gardens is a small water park situated along the Ngalaik Dam, near Kyweshin Village on Ngalaik Lake (approximately seven miles from Naypyidaw). Opened in 2008, facilities at the Ngalaik Lake Gardens include water slides, natural resorts, lodging and a beach. The gardens are open to the public during Thingyan holidays.
	 		<br><br>
	 		Uppatasanti Pagoda is similar in size and shape to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Uppatasanti Pagoda was completed in 2009. This new pagoda is named the Uppatasantior "Peace Pagoda". The stake-driving ceremony for the pagoda was held on 12 November 2006.The invitation card for the ceremony opened with a phrase "Rajahtani Naypyidaw (the royal capital where the king resides)". The pagoda is just 30 cm shorter than the Shwedagon Pagoda. Uppatasanti translates roughly to "Protection against Calamity". It is the name of a sutra prepared by a monk in the early 16th century. It is to be recited in time of crisis, especially in the face.

	 		It is located on a hillock and the landmark of downtown Pyay. About the same time that the pagoda on Hpo Oo Taung hill was built, the celestials of the hill built another pagoda. It must be built on the hill overlooking the site where Srikshetra was to be. Today " Shwe-san-daw" Pagoda ("The Sacred Hair Relic Shrine") as it is called, is one of the holiest pagodas for the Myanmar Buddhists. The Hti (Glorious Crown), the gold gilded iron framework on top, is richly embedded with jewels. Close by the hill on which Shwe San Daw Pagoda is a colossal seated Buddha statue recently renovated.

It is well known for hand-woven silk textiles and Shwe Nat Taung Pagoda on the hill. It stands on the Yangon-Pyay motor road. Shwe Nat Taung pagoda was built about the same time as the Shwe San Daw and Hpo Oo Taung Pagodas; just after the Buddha prophesied the future glory of Srikshetra city. The people worshipped the hill, called the Golden Hill (Shwe Taung), believing that a great spirit was there. The Buddha gave them hair relics on His visit to the hill while they were propitiating the spirit. They built a pagoda to enshrine the hair relics, and named it Shwe Nat Taung after the hillon which it was built.

	 		What is surprising is a bespectacled Buddha image with gold-rimmed spectacles, sitting there in Yun-dai (Lacquer ware row) quarter in Shwe Taung. Shwe Taung is a district town in the Bago division. If you motor down South from Pyay some six or seven miles, you'd get to Shwe Taung town. How come Buddha with gold-rimmed glasses? You wonder. The bespectacled Buddha image, sits cross-legged on a throne of sorts. Quite a colossus! King Dut-ta-buang, the founder of Thare-khittra built this Buddha image - without spectacles, of course; later it so happened that the king lost his eyesight; on the advice of his royal astrologers he set 'glasses' to the eyes of the image, some time after which he regained his eyesight; later, however, the Buddha image was deprived of its gold-rimmed spectacles by some unscrupulous burglars; so that in AD 1885 the year the British occupied the whole of Myanmar when King Thibaw, the last king of Kone-baung dynasty, donated a second pair of gold-rimmed spectacles, but to safeguard it from being stolen, it was enshrined along with the relics. The third pair of spectacles deteriorated or got damaged and has since been renovated or repaired by Daw Se` and family of Tha-yet-taw Quarter, ShweTaung.

	 		Vistitors to Myanmar often visit the hill resort town of Taunggyi and Kalaw and the beautiful Inle Lake nearby; all located in the southern part of the Shan State. They sometimes miss seeing another picturesque town in the same region famous for its ancient caves, a tranquil lake with an avenue of some of the biggest banyan trees, whose massive spreading branches provide cool, shady places for picnics. Pindaya is only about 28 miles (45 km) by car from Kalaw which can be reached by the railway which goes on to Shwe Nyaung, the terminus for Naung Shwe and the Inle Lake. Alternatively, Pindaya can bereached by car from Heho airport, the journey taking only about two hours. About 45minutes drive from Kalaw, the road from Kalaw to Pindaya is a breathtaking beauty of the region. Pindaya is 3,880 feet above the sea level, and is situated at the foot of a western ridge of mountains over 5,000 feet high. The road from Kalaw or Taunggyi to Pindaya goes through the little town of Aung Ban, famous for its sweet tangerine groves. This scenic rode between Aung Ban and Pindaya is one of the loveliest in the Shan State passing through enchanting villages like Pwe Hla where over two thousand Shan, Pa-oand Danu hill tribes' people live. You can see fields of red-coloured earth where patatoes and cabbages are grown and sent by trucks to all over Myanmar. There are also fields of dry cultivated mountain rice, tangerine orange groves, avocado orchards and other vegetables and fruits all along this fertile area. Pindaya Township covers about 85 square miles, with a population of over 20,000 hill tribe people. The majority of the population is Taung-yoe, but there are also Danu, Taung-thu, Shan, Palaung, Bama and Intha people. The people are very likeable and friendly and are sure to give visitors a warm welcome. Visitors approaching Pindaya by road will se a welcome concrete sign-post with a huge black spider in the centre of its web towering above. This buge spider is connected with the legendary history of Pindaya. Legend says that the name Pindaya comes from "Pinku" (Spider) and "Ya" (get). Both the picturesque lake "Pone Ta Loke" and the limestone cave "Shwe U Min" play a part in the legend. Thousands of years ago, seven princesses were so absorbed with playing at Pindaya lake. They soon realized that it was too dark to go back. They looked around and decided to stay overnight, in the harmless looking Pindaya cave. But at mid-night, a huge spider sealed the cave's entrance with its web. The next morning, the princesses discovered that were locked in. A passing prince heard their cries for help and he comes to rescue them. When he ﬁnally killed the huge spider, he exclaimed "Pinku Ya-Pyi" means "I've got the spider". From that time on, the place come to be known as "Pinku Ya". Later on, it corrupted to Pintara, and then to "Pindaya". It is all about how the name of "Pindaya" gets into being. The name Pindaya according to the legend comes from Pingu (meaning spider in Myanmar) and ya (meaning get). Scholars say that actually Pin in Shan means "a wide plain". Pindaya is located on a plain, actually a plateau; with abound ant water from the Zawgyi River and also from smaller streams and lakes. This has enabled the local people to cultivate the land extensively.

	 		Mawlamyine is at the mouth of the Thanlwin (Satween) & Gyaing Rivers and the Attaran Creek entering the sea. Located 28 miles from the sea, it is the second busiest seaport & third largest city in Myanmar. Rail and motor road from Yangon via Bago ends at Moketama (Martaban Gulf) 169 miles and then ferry across by launch. The railroad continues south up to Ye terminal (90 miles), but the motor road continues up to Myeik (Mergui). Air flight from Yangon, sea-going vessels, coastal boats and inland-river crafts play up & down. Visitors to Mawlamyine are simply enchanted at the scenic beauty and its temperate climate. Many pagodas of renown and the highlight of the Maungngan festival is the lavish alms-giving to over a thousand monks in the month of Thadingyut (Sept-Oct). The atmosphere of post-colonial decay is still palpable here. It's also an attractive and tropical town with a ride of stupa-capped hills on one side and the sea on the others. Mawlamyine was the capital of British Burma from 1827 to 1852, during which time it was a major teak port. Although, Pathein (Bassein) and Yangon have superseded it as Myanmar's most important seaports, much coastal shipping still goes on. It's the third largest city composed of 75% Mon or some mixture of Mon, Karen, Bamar, Indian and Chinese.

The holy tooth, collar-bone and frontlet of Lord Buddha were presented as a gift by the King of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka ) to King Anawrahta who made a sole mnvow stating "Let the white elephant kneel in the place where the holy relic is fain to rest!" Where the elephant knelt was where Anawrahta built the Shwezigon, but he only finished the three terraces before his death. King Kyansitta was by Shin Arahan to complete the pagoda, which he did in seven months and seven days

The balancing rock seems to defy gravity, as it perpetually appears to be on the verge of rolling down the hill. The rock and the pagoda are at the top of Mt. Kyaiktiyo. It is the third most important Buddhist pilgrimage site in MyNmar after the Shwedagon Pagoda (Yangon) and the Mahamuni Pagoda (Mandalay).
